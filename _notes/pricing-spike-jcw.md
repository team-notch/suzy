## initial hypothesis on best way to price suzy
People want flexibility to choose what they want for a monthly fee.

I think the best way to price suzy would be to have an initial set up fee, then Frank or Susan can decide to add any combination or number of widgets they want for a monthly fee per widget. This gives flexibility to Frank and Susan, while at the same time gives us the ability to sell the product to not only people who want all suzy has to off but also the people who may only want a certain feature of suzy.

Initial Questions:
- what are the costs of running suzy for 1 user?
- do we need to host their site in order for this to work?
- is hosting factored into the cost of running suzy?
- what type of contract do we need to ensure we get paid?
- how do we handle "support" or maintenance for a site?
- WE DO NOT WANT TO BE AN END ALL/BE ALL SOLUTION FOR PEOPLE... so are we just a facilitator?
- Does this model grow well in regards to expenses vs. money coming in?

## competitors/other CMS
**Light CMS** http://www.lightcms.com/pricing: pricing is based on amount of pages/storage/products(not sure what products are...), there is no set-up fee, it is interesting how each site gets every feature... but is that overwhelming? Our users know exactly what they want their site to do. Once they get to do that they might want to expand out into other widgets.
		- $19/mo personal
		- $29/mo standard
		- $49/mo premium
		- $69/mo professional
		- $99/mo unlimited

**SquareSpace** http://www.squarespace.com/pricing/: pricing is either annual(even thought is is shown per month) or on a month to month basis and is based on upgrading in features/abilities. What if someone wants something from the top of line, but nothing from the middle of the line option? This is too cookie-cutter.
		- standard: $8/mo annual ($96) or $10/mo
		- unlimited: $16/mo annual($192) or $20/mo
		- business: $24/mo annual ($288) or $30/mo

**Churchsites** http://www.churchsites.com/pricing.asp: pricing is based on features/storage/administartors. On top of the price per month there is a set up fee and/or monthly fee for: mobile sites, additional storage, email help desk (whatever that is), donation systems, fundraising systems, general e-commerce/payment systems, and dedicated server with SSL certificate. LOOKS LIKE WE ARE IN THE WRONG BUSINESS... these fuckers are scamming places of worship. (I am not going to go into various add on prices and set-up fees cause I need a PHD to figure it out. Visit the site)
		- Basic: $199 set-up & $9.95/mo
		- Standard: $299 set-up & $25/mo
		- Advanced: $399 set-up & $50/mo
		- Power: $499 set-up & $100/mo (for the mega-super-religous-get-into-heaven-free church)
